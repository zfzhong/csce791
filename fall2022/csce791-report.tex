\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & AI for science:  How machine learning and deep
learning are transforming materials discovery \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Jianjun Hu \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Hu presented his work of using AI tools (GAN, Transformer, etc) to
learn the structures/features of materials and molecules.  He
presented his work on three subjects: 1) generative design of material
composition, 2) generative design of cubic crystal structures, and 3)
generative design of molecules.


He presented the \emph{one-hot matrix} as an effective numeral
representation of known materials. On top of that he applied GAN to
generate new matrices that make senses. These generated material
should chemically make sense (bounded by many chemical rules). He also
presented the way of validating his results.


He also presented many details of his work on design of cubic crystal
structures and design of molecules. He also mentioned an algorithm
he borrowed from text generation and applied to design of
molecules.


His results on these subjects are remarkable. I believe pushing his
discovery to help develop new materials might make great impact in the
future.



\subsection{Q\&A}
At the end of the talk, I asked two questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item I pointed out that the one-hot matrices he developed as numeral
  representation of material structure is most likely sparse, and
  asked him the possibility of using simple ways (for example, some
  kind of linear combination of a series of matrices) to generate new
  matrices that make senses. He responded that it's a great insight to
  realize the matrices are sparse, and other researchers tried some
  different ways but they did not get meaingful results.
  
\item I asked the possibility of extending his work as a useful tool
  for material scientists to develop new materials. He responded that
  it would be his next-step work.
  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Talk on September 9, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & AI $\times$ Mathematics \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Petar Veličković\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Veličković presented his work that applies machine learning tools
to solve difficult problems in mathematics. His team has been working
on this project for about 1.5 years.


He gave a brief introduction on Coxeter Group theory and introduced
the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture, which has stood for about 50
years. They employed the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and trained the
model over dataset of intervals up to $S_9$, and the GNN learned to
predict KL coefficients significantly better than chance. Using
gradient saliency to identify salient nodes and edges by the GNN, they
improved the model and got more than 95\% accuracy in predicting KL
coefficients.


With a well understanding of the model, they developed \emph{hypercube
decomposition} of the Bruhat interval, and found it very promising for
inductively computing the KL coefficients. Based on their experimental
results, they proposed a new conjecture which is waiting for proof.


\subsection{Q \& A}

%I am too old to educate anyone. But when I was a PhD student in UT
%Austin many years ago, I was advised to ask at least one question
%(even silly ones) for any talk I attend. Even though I ended up
%dropping out from the program,  I always keep that in mind when I
%walk into a talk conference room -- what is the question that I am
%going to ask?


At the end of the talk, I asked one question:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I noticed that for the case $q$, their prediction achieves
  99.9\% accuracy. I believe they examined the instances of the 0.1\%
  which were not covered by their prediction. I asked: were these
  instances (among the 0.1\%) of significant importance?
  

He responded ``yes". He even disclosed that examining these instances
helped them develop the hypercube decomposition (if I understand
correctly).


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Topic}: & Can We Ever Trust Our Chatbots? Towards Trustable Collaborative Assistants\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Biplav Srivastava\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Srivastava introduced chatbot related research in his talk. He presented chatbots as collaborative assistants for decision support system that engage one or more people in conversation. He also presented the conceptual architecture of chatbots -- a data-driven dialog system. He showed some case studies of chatbots, and then pointed out the problem with trust for chatbots.

For the problem of trust, he discussed several components of the issue: competent, reliable, social values, and human-technology interaction, etc. These discussions gave the audience better understanding of the issue.

In the last part, he discussed some possible ways of making chatbots more trustable. He covered testing, AI robustness, randomized control trial and the idea of rating AI based on their behavior. I believe these means generally make sense, but I also should acknowledge that many of these are beyond my expertise.

\subsection{Q \& A}
I wanted to ask some questions but only to found out that I was not in the right position to ask good questions that make senses.

\section{Talk on September 23, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & The Gregarious Machines\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Amitava Das\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Amitava Das gave a talk on human behavior and personality study. He believes that such study is important for the development of artificial intelligence. 

He showed some interesting results from his research about using machine learning tools to analyze human characteristics. For example, it's interesting to learn how he defines \textit{community} of human society (According to Dr. Das, \emph{Communities} are dense sub-networks within a loose-connected network). Dr. Das also introduced his study on hate speech, and he showed that a group of people with certain characteristics are likely to generate hate speech. 

Generally, he gave the high level ideas without going to the technical details of applying machine learning tools. He also showed some videos to demonstrate the power of machine learning applied to studying human behaviors and characteristics.

\subsection{Q \& A}
At the end of the talk, I asked one question: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item When identifying the group of people who are likely to generate hate speech, is the environment that an individual stays in an important factor that is likely to affect him/her to behave? \\ \\
He said ``yes''. He mentioned that a certain result might come from the joint effect of human personality and the community environment where people stay in. His study on the \textit{communities} of human society is to address causes from the environment aspects. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Talk on October 7, 2022}

\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Logic meets Learning: From Aristotle to Neural Networks\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Vaishak Belle\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Belle holds the view that logic reasoning can be used to extend the boundaries of machine learning. In this talk, he gave several examples where logic reasoning and learning are combined together. I roughly got the high level ideas of these examples without understanding them in depth. 

Dr. Belle also listed several research areas where logic reasoning is widely used in connection to learning. Logic can help learning in many ways, while learning can address the fundamental equation of how to arrive at symbolic knowledge. 

I believe logic reasoning can be more widely used in learning, and learning can help disclose the logic connection in data as well.


\subsection{Q \& A}
At the end of the talk, I asked one question:
\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Since many researchers are trying to use machine learning tools to solve math test problems, I think it is a topic that logic reasoning should be combined with machine learning. I asked him for comments. I asked the question simply because a machine can not verify the correctness of its solution to a math problem without knowing the math logic behind that problem.\\ \\
In his response, I believe that he talked about how it's been done: giving the machine a set of examples to train a solver, and then applying the solver to another set of problems. He also talked about the pros and cons.\\


\end{enumerate}

\section{Talk on October 21, 2022}

\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Harnessing Mean Field Game and Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Emerging Transportation Modeling\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Xuan (Sharon) Di \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Di introduced her work on designing optimal controls for autonomous vehicles. There are several levels of abstraction in her work. First, she used certain models to represent real world problems with traffic and routing assumptions. Second, she formulated optimization problems based on these models, and solved these optimization problems subsequently. 

Later she introduced her work that employed machine learning tools to solve transportation problems. One particular point is that she believes incorporating physical logic into machine learning will help achieve better results. She evaluated her work with real traffic data. 

Her talk was very theoretical with many formulas and equations. The high level ideas of her work were easy to understand, but I could not really get these math abstraction and modeling. 



\subsection{Q \& A}
Since her model involves traffic balancing and best route selection, I asked if she considered extreme scenarios where a single factor (distance or time, for example) might be significantly important than any other factors. 

She said that was already taken care by her model, because in her model the weight on each factor is adjustable. If she wants to favor one factor, she will just increase the weight of that factor in her model.

\section{Talk on October 28, 2022}

\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Physical Layer Reliability for Air-Ground and Air-Air Networking\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. David W. Matolak\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Matolak introduced the fundamental problems existing in air-group and air-air communications: objects moving fast in air and the interference tends to be higher. He showed that the problem is crucial by giving a lot of application examples: air crafts, drones, military applications, etc. 

He showed his study about different characteristics of physical media, and how antennas affects these characteristics. He proposed a dual-band antenna design. He evaluated his design by experiments with the Civil Air Patrol of south carolina.

At last, he introduce some future work on low-altitude air-ground and air-air measurement and modeling.

\subsubsection{Q \& A}
Since I am quite new to the research Dr. Matolak was talking about, I asked two questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the state of the art of the research in this area?
\item How hard would it be to put the multi-band design into reality?
\end{enumerate}

He introduced briefly current research with respect to different applications (commercial, military, etc). He mentioned that it's slow to put new design into reality because of safety concerns: People tends to be very conservative introducing new technology into this area since it requires not only changes in physical devices but also software updates, and any of which might cause safety issues.

\section{Talk on November 4, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Learning Object Detection from Repeated Traversals\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Kilian Weinberger\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}

Dr. Weinberger introduced his work on improving autonomous driving by machine learning techniques. Specifically, he pointed out that if a car is used in the same location multiple times, it should act wisely, realizing that it has come to the location before. 

His approach is to leverage and learn from repetition by allowing a neural network to save some of its activations in a geo-referenced database which can be retrieved later on. This approach builds a rich dataset that aid object detection in the the same location. For example, it is possible to recognize objects from far way even if these objects are only perceived by a few pixels or LiDAR points. 

He further showed that it is possible to completely bootstrap an object detection classifier only based on repetition. He claimed that his approach has the potential to drastically improve the accuracy and safety of self-driving cars, enable them for sparsely populated areas, and allow them to adapt naturally to their local environment over time.

In general, Dr. Weinberger's talk is about leverage repetition to improve detecting objects for self-driving cars. He solved the problem quite nicely and I don't have much doubt in it. 


\newpage
\section{Talk on November 11, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Regression analysis of arbitrarily censored data subject to potential left truncation\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Lianming Wang\\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Wang started his talk by introducing different types of survival data. He also gave several examples for the audience to understand the features of each type of data. 

He then introduced the goals of regression analysis of survival data. He covered basic concepts and notations, as well as popular models used in this area.

He later introduced his proposed estimation approach based on EM algorithm. He claimed that the proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. He validated his approach with two sets of data: childhood mortality data and prostate cancer screening data.

I am not an expert in his research area. From his talk, I am convinced that he made some improvement in existing models.

\newpage
\section{Talk on November 18, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & Towards Safe and Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems\\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Lu Feng\\
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Review}
Dr. Feng introduced several of his research projects on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). She pointed out the challenges to ensure safety and trustworthiness in existing CPS.

It's quite easy to understand those challenges. For example, how much should a user trust a self-driving car? She presented a video where a self-driving car is driving in an environment with various complex surrounding objects. However, it's hard to approach and tackle these challenges.

She presented her probabilistic model for these problems. In her model these problems become solvable with certain assumptions. I felt that her approach was quite novel even though it didn't look amazing at first glance. She also introduced some other projects and research results with CPS.
