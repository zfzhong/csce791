I didn't attend the talk, due to my improper management of time and meetings.

\textbf{Topic}: & AI for science:  How machine learning and deep learning are transforming materials discovery \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Jianjun Hu \\\\
\textbf{Abstract:} & Artificial intelligence and deep learning are increasingly transforming all scientific disciplines with their superior capability to learn to detect patterns from large amount of data and to learn predictive models from  data without relying upon theory or deep mechanistic understanding, with their capability to build generative models for inverse design of materials and molecules and with the models to generate synthetic data. 
In this talk, we present our research focusing on using deep learning and machine learning to discover and model the patterns in and relationships of structures and functions in materials and molecules and how to exploit such learned dark/implicit knowledge in deep learning based generative design of novel materials, graph neural network based materials property prediction, and deep learning based crystal structure prediction of inorganic materials. Considering that the number of inorganic materials discovered so far (~250,000) by humanity is only a tiny portion of the almost infinite chemical design space, our AI based data-driven computational materials discovery has the potential to transform the conventional trial-and-error approaches in materials discovery. \\

\subsection{Draft Notes}
climate change, energy crisis, cancers, diseases, 


look for energy efficient materials

look for better drugs

alphafold 2


introducing the achievements  of deep learning in AI, without manually figuring out features.

how to use DL to design new materials

four fundamental problems of science: materials, chemistry, physics, biology

predication with large data vs. experimental process 


the challenges of materials design: space groups, a lot of rules


rational design vs generative design

3 stories (3 research problems): generative design of material composition, ... 


1. design of material composition: 
dataset: 120000 known materials formula from materials project database
material formula generation $\rightarrow$ one-hot matrix generation

120000 matrices to generate a new matrix that makes sense (use GAN)

validity of generated materials (chemically reasonable)

2. generative design of cubic crystal structures

dataset: 388680 known cubic materials structures from OQMD database

cubicGAN


validated by DFT calculations

carolinamatdb.org

3. generative design of molecules  (transformer language model for sequence modeling and generation)

similar to reinforcement learning?

attention mechanism

molecules generation as a canvas rewriting process

borrow algorithm from MIT text generation paper

 
Question: I point out that most of the one-hot matrices should be sparse matrices, and ask will linear combination of those matrices generate matrices that make sense? He responded that's a good insight and continued to mention that there were other similar ways but his way is the best in terms of getting results that make senses.

I also suggest that this work can be a useful to guide material scientists to develop new materials. He agrees and says that's the next step.
