I didn't attend the talk, due to my improper management of time and meetings.

\section{Talk on September 2, 2022}
\begin{tabularx} {\textwidth}{r X}
\textbf{Topic}: & AI for science:  How machine learning and deep learning are transforming materials discovery \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Jianjun Hu \\
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Review}
Dr. Hu presented his work of using AI tools (GAN, Transformer, etc) to learn the structures/features of materials and molecules.  He presented his work on three subjects: 1) generative design of material composition, 2) generative design of cubic crystal structures, and 3) generative design of molecules. 

He presented the \emph{one-hot matrix} as an effective numeral representation of known materials. On top of that he applied GAN to generate new matrices that make senses. These generated material should chemically make sense (bounded by many chemical rules). He also presented the way of validating his results.

He also presented many details of his work on design of cubic crystal structures and design of molecules. He also mentioned the algorithm he borrowed from text generation and applied that to design of molecules. 

His results on these subjects are remarkable. I believe pushing his discovery to help develop new materials might make great impact in the future.


\subsection{Q\&A}
At the end of the talk, I asked two questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item I pointed out that the one-hot matrices he developed as numeral representation of material structure is most likely sparse, and asked him the possibility of using simple ways (for example, some kind of linear combination of a series of matrices) to generate new matrices that make senses. He responded that it's a great insight to realize the matrices are sparse, and other researchers tried some different ways but they did not get meaingful results. 
\item I asked the possibility of extending his work as a useful tool for material scientists to develop new materials. He responded that it would be his next-step work.
\end{enumerate}

%Question: I point out that most of the one-hot matrices should be sparse matrices, and ask will linear combination of those matrices generate matrices that make sense? He responded that's a good insight and continued to mention that there were other similar ways but his way is the best in terms of getting results that make senses.

%I also suggest that this work can be a useful to guide material scientists to develop new materials. He agrees and says that's the next step.
