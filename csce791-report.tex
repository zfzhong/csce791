I didn't attend the talk, due to my improper management of time and meetings.

\textbf{Topic}: & AI for science:  How machine learning and deep learning are transforming materials discovery \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Jianjun Hu \\\\
\textbf{Abstract:} & Artificial intelligence and deep learning are increasingly transforming all scientific disciplines with their superior capability to learn to detect patterns from large amount of data and to learn predictive models from  data without relying upon theory or deep mechanistic understanding, with their capability to build generative models for inverse design of materials and molecules and with the models to generate synthetic data. In this talk, we present our research focusing on using deep learning and machine learning to discover and model the patterns in and relationships of structures and functions in materials and molecules and how to exploit such learned dark/implicit knowledge in deep learning based generative design of novel materials, graph neural network based materials property prediction, and deep learning based crystal structure prediction of inorganic materials. Considering that the number of inorganic materials discovered so far (~250,000) by humanity is only a tiny portion of the almost infinite chemical design space, our AI based data-driven computational materials discovery has the potential to transform the conventional trial-and-error approaches in materials discovery. \\
