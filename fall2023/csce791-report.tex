\textbf{Topic}: & AI research in the era of ChatGPT \\
\textbf{Speaker:} & Dr. Biplav Srivastava \\

\subsection{Summary}
Dr. Srivastava introduced the evolving of his AI research projects in the era of ChatGPT. He firstly introduced Plansformer, a system that solves planning tasks. Later, they developed Plansformer in to a new system with architecture call The SOFAI Planner, which incorporates LLM to help solve planning tasks.

Through his research experience, Dr. Srivastava conveyed the message that LLMs are exciting but not reliable, and thus it won't be directly applied to solve practical problems. However, Dr. Srivastava suggested that using LLMs as an efficient way to test research ideas, and then more trustworthy and reliable applications can be built based on what LLMs generate.

He mentioned that ChatGPT responds with different answers for similar questions, and that might cause people not using it because it's behavior is not very predictable (which might be considered as faulty). I would say that for some questions there is no exact answer, and ChatGPT is smart in answering these questions.
